# GHG and Soil Carbon Uncertainty Analysis.

IPCC Good Practice Guidance for GHG inventories recommends conducting uncertainty analyses. However, these are rarely done, especially in developing countries' inventories. Here we will be creating basic tools to conduct uncertainty analysis for livestock emissions and soil carbon stock changes.

The model is found in the GHG_Emissions_Function.R file. The report 'Greenhouse gas emissions model' (GHG_model_report.Rmd) shows the overview of the GHG emissions model with general uncertainties. The report 'Greenhouse gas emissions model - making scenarios' (Scenarios_report.Rmd) shows a model overview with scenarios defined.
